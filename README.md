Template for Quarkus config spec

## Introduction

MicroProfile Starter has generated this MicroProfile application for you.

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/ .

## Packaging and running the application

If you want to build an _??ber-jar_, execute the following command:

    mvn package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar

To run the application:

    java -jar target/configquarkustemplate-runner.jar

The application can be also packaged using simple:

    mvn package

It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it is not an _??ber-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

To launch the test page, open your browser at the following URL

    http://localhost:8080/index.html

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

    mvn compile quarkus:dev

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Creating a native executable

Mind having GRAALVM_HOME set to your Mandrel or GraalVM installation.

You can create a native executable using:

    mvn package -Dquarkus.package.type=native

Or, if you don't have [Mandrel](https://github.com/graalvm/mandrel/releases/) or
[GraalVM](https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-builds/releases) installed, you can run the native executable
build in a container using:

    mvn package -Dquarkus.package.type=native -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true

Or to use Mandrel distribution:

    mvn package -Dquarkus.package.type=native -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true -Dquarkus.native.builder-image=quay.io/quarkus/ubi-quarkus-mandrel:20.3-java11

You can then execute your native executable with:

    ./target/configquarkustemplate-runner

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image.

## Specification examples

By default, there is always the creation of a JAX-RS application class to define the path on which the JAX-RS endpoints are available.

Also, a simple Hello world endpoint is created, have a look at the class **HelloController**.

More information on MicroProfile can be found [here](https://microprofile.io/)

### Config

Configuration of your application parameters. Specification [here](https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config)

The example class **ConfigTestController** shows you how to inject a configuration parameter and how you can retrieve it programmatically.
